Here is a test post. I'm making it much longer than it needs to be to test the functionality of the fade-on-scroll feature, which I only want to happen on the home page. Since most other pages involve scrolling to view all the available content, I think it would probably be jarring to have all the content suddenly fade when someone is just innocently trying to view the bottom of the page.
